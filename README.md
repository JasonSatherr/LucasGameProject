# LucasGameProject
My first cpp game

Currently a WIP
---
Built because I needed more cpp experience, and my people keep getting mad at me when I play Lucas :zap: :fire: on SSBU :(

Thus, I need some way to enjoy the mechanics of the character without making others angry :( ... unless I become a villian :)))

---

For now, just clone this all into a 2019 Visual Studio, build and run!
